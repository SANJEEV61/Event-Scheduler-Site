How to run?

Step 1: Download the code from Github repository. Extract the zip folder.

Step 2: Download XAMPP Control Panel. By default a folder named XAMPP will be stored in C Drive.

Step 3: In XAMPP folder find htdocs folder. Copy and paste the extracted zip folder into htdocs holder.

Step 4: Open XAMPP Control Panel. Start the Apache and MYSQL modules. After starting the MYSQL module click on Admin. This takes us to phpMyAdmin.

Step 5: Click on new and create a new Database. In our case database name is "lms_db".

Step 6: Once Database is created successfully, click on import. Import the database which resides in SQL folder of the downloaded source code.

step 7: Now type localhost/eventschdulersite(folder name) in your favourite web browser. A localhost(127.0.0.1) for your system will be created which runs the 
        PHP code efficiently with fully functional database.
